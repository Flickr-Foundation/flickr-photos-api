# CHANGELOG

## v1.5.4 - 2023-12-21

*   Add some basic retrying logic to the client.
    If you get a 500 Internal Server Error from the Flickr API, the request will now be retried up to three times before failing.
    
    All other errors will raise immediately.

## v1.5.3 - 2023-12-21

*   Provide a better error when you pass an empty string as a Flickr API key.
    Now it will fail when you create the client, whereas previously it would fail with an `Invalid API Key` error when you tried to call the Flickr API.

## v1.5.2 - 2023-12-19

*   Fix a bug in the handling of "date taken" when the value returned by the Flickr API is `0000-00-00 00:00:00`.

## v1.5.1 - 2023-12-19

*   Discard location information with an accuracy level of `0`, which seems to mean "so vague as to be meaningless".

## v1.5.0 - 2023-12-19

*   Add a method `get_buddy_icon_url(user_id: str)` for retrieving the buddy icon of a user.

## v1.4.0 - 2023-12-18

*   Bump the minimum Python version to 3.12.
*   Slightly rejig the "date_taken" field â€“ it now returns `None` if the taken date is unknown, rather than `{"unknown": True}`.
