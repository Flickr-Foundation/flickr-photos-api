      \ I realise the demands on the staff running and working in the National Library
      and the amount of time this must take to research, choose, digitise and then
      upload each shot with the moderation that is necessary if you are to keep spammers
      out.  \nOn the other hand this stream was reaching all over the world and garnering
      valuable information on the photographs and the time when they were taken.  It
      would be a pity to lose the momentum that has been gained and I for one would
      be happy to help in a practical way if that were possible!\nWell trained dogs

      [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75556178@N05]  I&#039;d echo what you&#039;re
      all saying here, having worked in the cultural sector on digital projects for
      many, many years. I&#039;ve also read with interest your comments on the previous
      thread. I&#039;d also add that not just any Library, but particularly any commercial
      company, would give big bucks to have someone who could build and engage with
      an audience the same way that this photostream has done for the last few years.\n\nIt&#039;s
      ironic that a reason given here is to allow information to be integrated into
      the catalogue, something that is relatively easy using the API, compared with,
      say, trying to harness information from Twitter replies or Facebook comments.
      And also that the stock reply seems to be to look at the online catalogue, which
      although good by most museums&#039; standards is still difficult to use and
      crucially has no crowdsourcing or social elements to it.\n\nI&#039;ll end with
      a few NL Ireland stats that I hope give some perspective and objectiveness (though
      it&#039;s hard to find directly comparable metrics, and they&#039;re rather
      hastily thrown together so could do with verifying):\n\nFlickr Commons \n- taking
      the image before last as a typical example (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/12218808006/&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/12218808006/&lt;/a&gt;)
      this has had 33,356 views, 110 favourites and 11 comments. The comments have
      identified the date and are generally very informed (and to coin a social media
      phrase, the commenters are very &#039;engaged&#039;).\n- as was posted on the
      previous image, the most popular image has had over 250,000 &#039;views&#039;,
      and a number of images have had over 100 comments (with high tens being the
      norm from what I have seen)\n\nTwitter\n- the most popular recent @nlireland

      has had 41 retweets, 19 favourites and five replies, four of which were along
      the lines of &#039;How sweet&#039;.\n- there have been about 340 links to &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://catalogue.nli.ie/*&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;catalogue.nli.ie/*&lt;/a&gt;
      in tweets over the last two years or so. In roughly the same period there were
      660 links to flickr.com/photos/nlireland/*\n\nFacebook\n- the recent post of
      WW1 images for Valentine&#039;s Day attracted 90 likes, 42 shares and 5 comments\n\nPinterest\n-
      I also always find Pinterest a great indicative measure of engagement and if
      you take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pinterest.com/source/catalogue.nli.ie/&quot;

      I can see just 264 Pins in two years, which is very low. Unfortunately you can
      only do this at domain level so it is not possible (as far as I know) to just
      look at a specific Flickr photostream, but I suspect The NLI Flickr Commons
      images would be very well represented.\n\nThinking with my professional hat
      on, I would love to take a look at the NLI site&#039;s web stats and also their
      Flickr stats and check referrals from these channels as this would give a must
      more meaningful measure of &#039;success&#039;.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641109132324\"

      to say it but I suspect you are stopping posting temporarily in the hope that
      we will just lose interest and go away and you will then stop on a permanent
      basis using lack of interest in the site as an excuse. Given the incredible
      amount of erudition evident in the comments on this site there are surely numerous
      people in and around Dublin who could continue the posting and who would &#039;sell
      their soul&#039; to do so. The photographs posted on this site have greatly
      increased my appreciation of Irish history and encouraged me to read extensively
      on the subject, something we are not taught in schools in the UK (in 1968, believe
      it or not,  Parnell and Home Rule were mentioned as a sideline to Victorian
      History and that was it), and literature. It is an invaluable site for anyone
      with an interest in and who appreciates the works of James Joyce and considering
      the amount of quotations from Joyce are many. Please can you reconsider your
      decision and resume your posting sooner rather than later.</comment>\n\t<comment

      the skills and the dual benefits of time and memories going back over  50 or

      by NLI.\n\nThe digitalisation of our nation\u2019s photographic archives and
      publication on Flickr has provided an opportunity for interested parties to
      research and comment.  The interest in Ireland\u2019s history that this site
      has inspired is phenomenal \u2013 as evidenced by the number of views and comments
      that each photograph provokes.\n\nThis is the wrong decision and I join the

      way lots of (Typical) Irish Historical decisions are taken, the perception of
      &amp;quot;unimportance&amp;quot; \nHistorians would have loved pictures of the
      Battle of Clontarf, or of many similar historic incidents, instead we got artistic

      to the above and thank you for the invitation to comment. Since discovering
      the NLI site I have been a regular visitor. It seems to be the only Commons
      site where the active involvement of the many contributors (not least Danny8)
      have led to the discovery of so much more information which can only add to
      this great catalogue of history. My Great Grandparents were born somewhere round
      Sligo, Fermanagh so I have a vested interest in keeping my eye open. Unfortunately
      Major Ruttledge-Fair is doubtfully related. \n\nUnlike the American Congress
      Commons site, the many contributors to this site, add so much more interest.
      I am sorry to hear the decision to pause. You may be dispensing with a great
      asset in those many contributors mentioned. I would ask you to reconsider -

      and I&#039;d like to assume it is not taken lightly but is a result of diminished
      resources in the NLI which in turn is a reflection on the current government&#039;s
      attitude to anything which doesn&#039;t immediately and explicitly pay its way.
      The collective research carried out over the last number of years on the NLI
      Flickr stream is immeasurable but invaluable.\n\nIf it is a question of resources
      there are many ways in which this could be tackled in the absence of public
      funding: outsourcing to volunteers; unpaid internships for young archivists;
      crowdfunding through FundIt or other sources...etc.\n\nWhere there is a will
      there is a way and, judging by the comments so far on this post, the will is
      certainly not absent!\n\nI hope that NLI reconsider their decision and work
      with the many dedicated volunteers who have contributed to the success of these

      made by the NLI should be rethought...\nsad... very valid points have been made...
      and your reason to\n discontinue is rather vague and not in the best interest
      of the\n people of Ireland and us of Irish descent around the world... \npraying
      you will reconsider and continue with this most \nworthwhile project bringing

      ahead of us so often in bringing their heritage to the people, took a very different
      line with pictures on its Flickr site. As far as I can see it doesn&#039;t encourage
      or answer comments - though the few comments it gets stay there as orphans on
      Flickr&#039;s great site.  What a pity if the National Library of Ireland changes
      its course of gaining knowledge while it is there.  I once had a man from the

      has limited resources, but I do think putting pictures here and getting comments
      would be a better use of resources than putting them on Facebook, where tagging,
      searching and commenting are so much less useful. People comment here somethimes
      months after the photos are posted, when an image search finds the photo. Facebook
      postings disappear in very short order, and are not usually found by image searches.</comment>\n\t<comment

      are hardly likely to have someone to upload in the future.\n\nThey have said
      it&#039;s too time consuming, there are cut backs all through Civil Service

      obvious the the NLI was just waiting to put a stop to the uploading of photos
      to Flickr, so I think it&#039;s wakey wakey time, NLI have their priorities
      else where, not only that, complimenting them for what they have done seems
      bizarre, the person we should be complimenting is GONE!\n\nThey have no obvious
      intention of coming back, their response to leaving here was, Customarily Vague

      by DannyM8, thanks!\nI haven&#039;t had a chance lately of commenting on the
      NLI&#039;s wonderful photos. It&#039;s a pity to see Carol will no longer be
      on Flickr and uploading photos, which for most of us since its inception has
      become an important everyday ritual to view and comment on, I wish her the very
      best in her new role and I hope she has seen all the kind words of support posted
      these last couple of weeks. \n\nI was so intrigued by the phenomenon and success
      of this photostream that it formed a very important aspect of my college dissertation
      about online photo-archives, so I value it and the dynamic that users have created
      from it greatly. There&#039;s evidence of many archival photostreams that have
      become dormant and fallen by the wayside, and this is something which I hope
      will never happen to the NLI&#039;s. Integrating anything posted on here into
      the main catalogue will be time-consuming,  however I hope, like everyone else
      here does, that this pause will be brief and that the value of work generated

      who considers this a bad decision. I contributed very little by way of comments
      to the wonderful photos uploaded so regularly by Carol but always made time
      to read and learn and of course be entrained by the banter. \n\nProjects like
      this are usually driven by one or two enthusiastic people and the sad fact is
      that once they leave the whole thing collapses. \n\nI would urge the NLI to
      take a step back and realise what an important FREE resource you will be loosing
      by this decision. Myrthle26 made the point that most other institutions undertake
      projects like this almost begrudgingly, (PRONI is a case in point) but what
      Carol and all the commenters have achieved over the last few years is truly
      remarkable - It would be plain foolish to reject such a generous offer of help

      path_alias=\"abaraphobia\" realname=\"Mike\">In the dark days before Flickr,
      photo albums &amp;amp; collections sat around in people&#039;s cupboards or
      lofts, gathering dust, and perhaps people would occasionally dust them off to
      have a quick browse; but now they can be scanned and uploaded for the entire
      world to see, and a percentage of those photos will actually relate directly
      to someone who chances upon them, or is actually conducting a search, and finds
      the information that has been attached to those photos, or added to it by other
      viewers.\nI feel it&#039;s therefore imperative that public bodies who hold
      archives of historically important photographs should be compelled to make as
      many of these images available to the public, as a matter of necessity; otherwise
      the connections between these images, and people who are alive today, will never
      be made, and all the information contained in them will be meaningless to future
      generations.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641133278793\"

      a solution - find a bright, enthusiastic member of library staff who understands
      the content and the audience, and has a passion for sharing and engaging. Let
      them - no, encourage them - to spend some of their time not pushing trolleys
      around or re-shelving books but delving into the collections and sharing that
      passion with an equally passionate and increasingly substantial audience.\n\nEnd
      result? The member(s) of staff gets an extra incentive to turn up at work each
      day and a sense of pride for what they are achieving; the library gets an incredible
      return in the form of publicity and awareness, access to the collections (a
      KPI for any public body), and enriched object information crowdsourced from
      a diverse and knowledgeable audience. And all that for a tenth of the price

      and &amp;quot;social media&amp;quot; as purely a (monodirectional) promotional
      tool seems a little short sighted. \n\nIt is a little disheartening that the
      library would continue to invest in supporting the FB stream (in the relatively
      value-less hunt for fatuous &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot;), and not invest a little
      in this stream in parallel (which has demonstrably returned valuable content
      to the catalogue AND those fatuous &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot;).\n\nThis is the
      real-world, and budgetary constraints, copyright considerations and other aspects
      which would influence any organisations decision to manage finite resources
      are not to be ignored. In particular I would understand concerns about the reliability,
      academic value and catalogue value of any reciprocated content. \n\nThat being
      said, I question the decision to &amp;quot;outsource&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;digital&amp;quot;
      role to an &amp;quot;agency&amp;quot;, and in doing so bundle this initiative
      alongside FB and Twitter as something to be measured in terms of purely &amp;quot;marketing
      ROI&amp;quot;. \n\nAnyway, I look forward to the break being relatively short.

      vote to encourage not to &amp;quot;close up shop&amp;quot; - this would be indeed
      a tragedy.  I have commented only at the odd times, but have always taken a
      keen interest in the photographs, information, comments and at times a great
      sense of humour that appeared on these pages !\n\nFrom Australia&#039;s earliest
      European settlements - the penal colonies of His Majesty King George - Irish
      men and women have contributed to the unique character of the Australian.  Not
      only as convicts, who in the vast majority of cases stayed on as settlers when
      their deportation sentence had been served,  but Irish free men and women settled
      here, looking for a new life, away from the restrictions of the European &amp;quot;establishments&amp;quot;.
      \  \nFrom immigrants fleeing the potato famine, adventurers seeking their fortunes
      on the goldfields,  settlers looking for land to start up a lifetime of farming
      \ to famous personalities such as the outspoken Archbishop Daniel Mannix  of
      Melbourne who spoke long and loud against the conscription during World War
      I, and his support during the Irish fight for independence in the early 1920&#039;s,
      to the contributions, made by Irish settlers and their now &amp;quot;Australian&amp;quot;
      descendants,  to the early Australian ballads\nwhich have survived to the current
      time in the musical halls of fame - all these have contributed to the Aussie
      &amp;quot;psyche&amp;quot;.\n\nThis site has contributed much, taught us much,
      and enlightened much, our understanding of a large part of our ancestry and
      consequently of who we are and why we are.\n\nFor this site to close or cease
      activity, and the loss of the knowledge it has, and should continue to impart
      -  would be an absolute catastrophe.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641153910524\"

      Your social media presence on Flickr and Twitter were the best of any institution
      with which I am familiar. It raised the profile of your institution internationally.
      It helped you crowdsource information that surely would have taken much more
      staff time to research offline alone, and it humanized you because of the great
      sense of humor that was evident throughout. You really can&#039;t put a price
      on that.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641156567024\"

      upload from NLI. These images speak volumes about our history in a way that
      words never could.\n\nThe decision to stop posting is a sad one indeed. The
      Flickr site was a valued resource for people the world over, both for research
      purposes but also for the sheer enjoyment it gave. The NLI staff involved have
      been amazingly dedicated in looking after it. Public archives can still sometimes
      be stuffy and forbidding places but this site has achieved a level of accessibility
      and informality that many institutions would envy. The National Library and
      the National Archives are in a sorry state at the moment due to budget cutbacks.
      Staff morale seems to be at an all-time low. There was a great opportunity during
      the &#039;boom&#039; years when we were awash with money to build dedicated
      buildings for these institutions but nothing was done. We have hundreds of useless
      hotels and shopping centres but our cultural treasures are falling apart. Politicians
      seem to fear archives.\n\nPlease reconsider this decision.</comment>\n\t<comment

      that an organization who had the good sense to share these images on Flickr
      in the first place (and look at the results! How many mysteries were solved
      so quickly at so little cost to NLI?) now has the terrifically horrible sense
      to stop what had been a most engaging, interesting program. This is incredibly

      THe decision to put this project on seemingly indefinite hold is a disappointing
      one. The popularity of this stream is immense and the contribution of Carol
      can never be under-estimated, likewise the comments and really good information
      supplied by many Flickr members in the comments sections. \n\n&amp;quot;How
      to resource the project&amp;quot;? How much could be involved in adding the
      trove of information to the uploaded pictures in the NLI database? I would assume
      that in putting these pictures on Flickr (stitches in time and a wonderful insight
      into the history of our country), the NLI team were hoping from the outset to
      add to whatever (sketchy) information they already had. PLEASE KEEP THE PICTURES
      COMING, it would be a shame to cut off a wonderful resource in it&#039;s prime.\nJohn.</comment>\n\t<comment

      the free help you are throwing away in finding the unknown hiding in the photos.
      Don&#039;t go back to hiding the photos away in a dusty old corner never to
      see the light of day again these are public property and must be shared to everyone
      by public display and what a better place then on Flickr taking up no room on

      - any library - in the digital age? If the purpose of the library is to generate
      interest in the locale and discussion across disparate groups of people from
      around the globe, then the National Library of Ireland was, and is, a huge success.
      One photograph posted on Flickr to the National Library of Ireland could, and
      often did, generate hundreds of posts. And, I&#039;m sure, if there was a tracker
      on the visitors, the knockon effect of google searches for more information
      on, and about, any photo post would have been amazing. As I read the NLI post
      it doesn&#039;t say the posting on Flickr will stop, just that they are researching
      their digital media options, which is understandable. Hopefully, NLI will see
      the value of the Flickr postings and how rewarding it is to those who cherish
      all things Irish, and continue to allow us to look back and enjoy old Ireland.</comment>\n\t<comment

      path_alias=\"\" realname=\"\">So, now that I have time to offer you the benefit
      my musings (/hurl abuse at you) on this matter:\n\nI think you need to ask yourselves
      what the purpose of a national archive is. It cannot simply be to preserve historical
      documents; They must also be available to the public. If it is &amp;quot;write
      only&amp;quot;, to adopt a software term, it may as well not exist. If the aim
      in straitened circumstances is to preserve documents until such time as resources
      are available to make them public, you have to ask yourself, when will that
      day be? Why would it be more likely to be tomorrow than today?\nI would argue
      that in fact, it is more likely to be today than tomorrow. The goodwill towards
      the NLI and publicity afforded it that has been generated by the activity on
      the commons is probably unprecedented in the library&#039;s history. Not only
      are thousands upon thousands more people worldwide aware of the archives&#039;
      existence, but they are actively engaging with it. What better opportunity could
      you want to press the case for increased staffing, funding and activity? Instead
      of being seen as a black hole into which irrelevant old papers have disappeared,
      members of the public see the NLI as a valuable resource, particularly in the
      past year as The Gathering generated huge interest in genealogy and family history
      among both irish residents and the diaspora. Is it now the oficial position
      that with The Gathering over, we&#039;re finished with history?\nThe decision
      to abandon the commons, is, in my view, premature and shortsighted, and likely
      to consign the NLI back to the obscurity from which it only recently emerged.
      I would strongly urge you to reconsider this.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641259371644\"

      path_alias=\"maryade\" realname=\"\">Regarding the image itself (along with
      the other Clynagh/Claidhnach image recently on Facebook) - is this from the
      Congested Districts Boards file or is it separate? \n\nRegarding your decision,
      I think the decision to reduce your presence here, while potentially maintaining
      images on Facebook is not going to serve you in the long-run. With Facebook,
      their terms appear to want them to share copyright on the image thus allowing
      them to sell them onto other agencies, such as newspapers, without having to
      get explicit permission from yourselves. This is in direct contravention to
      your own copyright policies. \n\nAs for the images being available on the NLI
      website - the search algorithm does not appear to be as sophisticated as it
      could be. For example, there was a Longford-based image shared here which did
      not appear on any search on your online catalogue. Plus there is no comment
      function, which would require moderation granted. This site was brilliant for
      discovering true hidden-gems as well as getting peerless information about site
      and context.\n I can only hope that the funds are made available for the NLI
      to reverse this decision.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641263097993\"

      the chorus of disapproval at your decision. Most of us in England were never
      and still are not ever taught anything about Irish History in schools (if, nowadays,
      they are taught any history at all!!). All I was taught was Parnell and Irish
      Home Rule (and that only as an episode in Victorian history) and that was it.
      This is why this site is so important, it actually encourages the viewer to
      delve into Irish History (until I saw the photograph, I had never heard of the
      Irish Hell Fire Clubs or that there were books on the subject). In addition
      so many of the images are important to students and readers of your greatest
      writer of the 20th century - James  Joyce (with W B Yeats a close second). I
      have lost count of just how many of the images are relevant to his works. Yes
      I know there are a number of &#039;illustrated&#039; editions but none of them
      come anywhere near, in quality, the pictures already on the site and no doubt
      there are many more as yet unseen. What this site does, better than any other,
      give &#039;life&#039; to your history. Not only the images but the postings
      add to the experience. Never have I read such erudite commentaries on  photographs
      than those from those posting. The site is a credit to the NLI and the Irish
      people. Any decision to close it down (which is I suspect your aim) is an insult
      to your country. There is little, if any, appreciation of our history (good,
      not so good and downright disgraceful)  in this benighted country (England)
      at present. Please do not allow Ireland to fall into the same trap. History,
      as taught in schools (at least when I was there) was dull, boring and uninteresting
      - this site makes history interesting and alive. Please do not close it or terminate
      postings.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641375181205\"

      Jim, I only bumped into this site the other day via one of you friends.  It
      is obvious that (as Kaye said?) the importance to folk like yourselves that
      have Irish family history,  that this site is full of unique written information
      and a glorious array of photographic evidence of past Irish times.\nOver here
      the knee-jerk reactions in the name of austerity are so obvious to Brits over
      the last 4 years. This is a classic example of short sightedness that could
      be corrected with a relatively small amount of support.  As another commenter
      said, there is so much unemployment In Ireland ........ surely one would benefit
      the other.</comment>\n\t<comment id=\"47267889-12584715825-72157641403319303\"

      nice while it&#039;s lasted. Hope you find a way of continuing with this. I
      love the comments locating or dating mystery photos - a real pleasure. Perhaps
      as another project you could ask for photo&#039;s. My brother has been scanning
      a range of old family photos (from around 1900) nothing too special. Great grandma
      with a big (dead) bird on her head and granddad possibly in blue shirt uniform.

      path_alias=\"staticgirl\" realname=\"\">I went to a records manager meeting
      at the UK National Archives yesterday and time and time again we were reminded
      that records should conform to the following principles: transparency, integrity,
      protection, compliance, availability, retention, disposition and accountability.
      This photo-stream obeyed those principles to an excellent degree and the public
      benefited greatly as a result. The Welsh government is currently designing a
      solution to archive their web presence (they&#039;re on flickr too) and are
      using open-source tool. The NLI should talk to them, they might be able to advise
      whether the tools might benefit in this case. Plus if your system only deals
      with paper records you should upgrade the system because the near future is
      digital. It&#039;ll save money... \n\nI&#039;m really sorry this photo-steam
      is &#039;pausing&#039; (usually civil service speak for &#039;we haven&#039;t
      got any money left and are cancelling it.) I shall miss it and the blw banter.

      goes to waste as the  NLI &amp;quot;integrate the information generated over
      the last few years into our catalogue, and identify how to resource the project
      from now on.&amp;quot;  I bet there has been no integrating and no identifying.
      \   \n\nEven if the NLI sort out their priorities,  Flickr-as-we-knew-it is
      dying a slow painful death with its &#039;New Photo Experience&#039;*.  Comments,
      notes, tags, and banter are nearly impossible to read in the new format.   (I
      have resorted to the French old version as a temporary solution - &lt;i&gt;Merde!&lt;/i&gt;

      makes the new Flickr look positively luxurious and state of the art (exemplified
      by Niall using the comments here to post the location of one).\n\nAnd yet their
      sitewide web template has a prominent header link to Commons but none directly

      at this thread. It seems pretty clear that there is a community of people here
      that would like to help expand/enhance the archive. It doesn&#039;t seem to
      matter to the majority WHERE this is done (doesn&#039;t have to be Flickr -
      could be a feature on the catalog itself), but it&#039;d be a serious shame
      if this community was allowed to die or become (more) disenfranchised. Because
      when NLI do pop the heads back up again, and say &amp;quot;ok - we&#039;re ready
      for you now&amp;quot;, it&#039;ll be all the more complex (expensive) to rebuild

      heard that we are back and posting a new photo every weekday. Please do come
      by and comment away as normal. \n\nYou might also be interested in our latest
      online exhibition. \n\n&lt;b&gt;The 1916 Rising: Personalities and Perspectives.&lt;/b&gt;
      This study resource draws almost exclusively upon the collections of the National
      Library, including the Library\u2019s rich holdings of books, newspapers, photographs,
      drawings, proclamations and, not least, manuscript material.  In all, over 500
      images have been selected for study and analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nli.ie/1916/&quot;
