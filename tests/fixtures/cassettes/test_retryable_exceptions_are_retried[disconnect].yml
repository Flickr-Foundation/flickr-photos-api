        NMRC Trains Sailors for CTC Influenza Study 05.10.2024\nPhoto by Sidney Hinds
        \nNaval Medical Research Command  \n \nBETHESDA, Md. (May 10, 2024) Hospital
        Corpsman 1st Class Adirachel Sauvou, from Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC),
        instructs Hospitalman Vivien Taimai, from Naval Medical Leader and Professional
        Development Command, on drawing blood samples in preparation for a flu prevention
        study. The study, an ongoing trial conducted by the NMRC Clinical Trials Center
        (CTC), evaluates the efficacy of SAb Biotherapeutics therapy SAB-176, a novel
        infectious disease therapy designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 14,000,000
        medical visits, 360,000 hospitalizations and 21,000 deaths occurred in the
        United States due to influenza from 2022-2023. Influenza outbreaks can spread
        easily among active-duty service members, especially those living in congregate
        settings, reducing mission readiness. A prevention option that can be administered
        remotely could reduce disease burden and optimize health and operational readiness
        of Navy, Marine Corps and joint service personnel in all domains that may
        face a rapidly transmitted infectious disease threat.\n\nThis study is open
        to all healthy active-duty military, dependents, retirees, WRNMMC personnel
        and other local individuals between the ages of 18 and 60. Participants must
        not be pregnant, cannot have received a flu shot in the past 90 days and must
        be able to complete at least eight visits to the CTC over the course of three
        months. Active-duty personnel will be required to complete a supervisor\u2019s
        approval form. Participants may be eligible for compensation. If you would
        like to participate or have any questions, please contact the center at 301-233-9640
        (text), or via e-mail at usn.nmrc.ctc@health.mil to schedule an appointment.
        The CTC, located at Naval Support Activity Bethesda, Building 17B (2nd floor),
        evaluates vaccines, therapeutics, prophylactics and medical devices in human
        subjects to advance products from the laboratory to the front line and maximize
        the medical readiness of the warfighter. (U.S. Navy photo by Sidney Hinds/Released)\n\nDate

        Command (NMRC), instructs Hospitalman Vivien Taimai, from Naval Medical Leader
        and Professional Development Command, on drawing blood samples in preparation
        for a flu prevention study. The study, an ongoing trial conducted by the NMRC
        Clinical Trials Center (CTC), evaluates the efficacy of SAb Biotherapeutics
        therapy SAB-176, a novel infectious disease therapy designated by the U.S.
        Food and Drug Administration. According to the Centers for Disease Control
        and Prevention, more than 14,000,000 medical visits, 360,000 hospitalizations
        and 21,000 deaths occurred in the United States due to influenza from 2022-2023.
        Influenza outbreaks can spread easily among active-duty service members, especially
        those living in congregate settings, reducing mission readiness. A prevention
        option that can be administered remotely could reduce disease burden and optimize
        health and operational readiness of Navy, Marine Corps and joint service personnel
        in all domains that may face a rapidly transmitted infectious disease threat.\n\nThis
        study is open to all healthy active-duty military, dependents, retirees, WRNMMC
        personnel and other local individuals between the ages of 18 and 60. Participants
        must not be pregnant, cannot have received a flu shot in the past 90 days
        and must be able to complete at least eight visits to the CTC over the course
        of three months. Active-duty personnel will be required to complete a supervisor\u2019s
        approval form. Participants may be eligible for compensation. If you would
        like to participate or have any questions, please contact the center at 301-233-9640
        (text), or via e-mail at usn.nmrc.ctc@health.mil to schedule an appointment.
