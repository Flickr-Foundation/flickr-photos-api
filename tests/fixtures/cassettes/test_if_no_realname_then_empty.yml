      are almost three hundred year\u2019s of stories buried in our walls. ... ...\n...
      There is speculation about how the bar acquired it\u2019s current name \u2018The
      Purty Kitchen\u2019. The local narrative is that an American visitor, who had
      embarked at Kingstown port, walked up to the door of no. 4 and said to the proprietress,
      \u201CSay Mamm, you sure have a mighty purty kitchen. ...\u201D &lt;/i&gt; \n\nFrom

      \n\n&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot; ... On the side of this road, past Monkstown, and about
      a mile from Dunleary, an excellent wayside inn was to be met, where thousands
      of people resorted, some for refreshments on their way to the sea coast to enjoy
      the sea breeze ; others went to the grounds to dance, pitch quits, play skittles,
      and drink genuine Irish whisky or Alley&#039;s famed ale at this house, well
      known as the &#039;Purty\nKitchen.&#039;   How the house received this name
      I know not,  but I have no doubt it was in consequence of &lt;u&gt;the coppers
      and pewter plates and dishes upon the dresser. These were kept more for ornament
      than use, and made as bright as hands could polish them&lt;/u&gt;.  In fact
      everything about the kitchen was in first-class order, and it was laughable
      to hear some of the ladies and gentlemen from Thomas-street and the Liberties
      of Dublin saying: &amp;quot;Oh, then, Jim, isn&#039;t it a purty kitchen? Look
      at the beautiful coppers and pewters.&amp;quot; \nJim would likely reply after
      this fashion: &amp;quot;Faith and it&#039;s myself would like to be sitting
      forninst one of thim dishes with a pig&#039;s head lying on a palliasse of cabbage
      upon it, and some good cup potatoes, and a quart of Guinness&#039;s stout to
      wash my dinner down.&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Just like you, Jim, always thinking
      of your stomach.&amp;quot; \nSo the fun would go on at the &#039;purty kitchen.&#039;
      ... ...&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;</comment>\n</comments>\n</rsp>\n"
