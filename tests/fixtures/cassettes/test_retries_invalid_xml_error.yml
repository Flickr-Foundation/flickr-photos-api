      Medicine is an integral part of today\u2019s Navy and Marine Corps team and
      has been a part of that team since the American Revolution. Today\u2019s Navy
      and Marine Corps team is engaged in a global power competition. Our country
      depends upon Navy Medicine\u2019s unique expeditionary medical expertise to
      prepare and support Naval forces, including both Navy and Marine forces. This
      renewed global power competition requires Navy Medicine to be more agile and
      capable of operating in a distributed maritime environment at the speed of our
      warfighters. The Navy-Marine Corps team\u2019s ability to prevail across the
      range of military operations is dependent upon their medical readiness and our
      ability to enhance their survival in the high-end fight. Today\u2019s Navy Medicine
      is built on the shoulders of those who came before us, including everything
      from shipboard and submarine medicine to research and development on the cutting
      edge of medical science. Items in this collection include both current and historical
      photos illustrating Navy Medicine\u2019s role in the defense of the United States
      of America. \n\nNavy Medicine participates in The Commons on Flickr to further

      Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) is the headquarters for the Navy
      Medicine enterprise. Under the leadership of Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, Navy
      surgeon general and chief, BUMED, Navy Medicine ensures Sailors, Marines and
      their families and retirees are healthy, ready and on the job \u2013 be it on
      land or sea.\n\nBUMED&#039;s Office of Medical History. A historical component
      has existed at the US Navy&#039;s Bureau of Medicine and Surgery since May 1907
      with the establishment of the Publications Office. In addition to producing
      The Naval Medical Bulletin, the Publications Office was responsible for producing
      occasional historical monographs, and maintaining a historical archive. Today
      the Office of Medical History&#039;s mission has evolved to preserve and promote
      the history and heritage of the Navy Medical Department while serving the needs
      of our customers. The collection consists of publications, public records, manuscripts,
      personal papers, hospital plans, Navy Hygiene Museum records, biographical files,
      subject files, facility files, films, videos, photographs, prints, drawings,
      and artifacts. The OMH currently consists of over 100 collections covering over
      1,000 linear feet and is staffed by a historian and an archivist. Non-photographic
      items from the BUMED&#039;s historian&#039;s office can be found on the Medical

      Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) optimizes the operational readiness and
      health of our armed forces by conducting research, development, testing, and
      evaluation to inform Department of Defense (DoD) policy. We have been designated
      the DoD Deployment Health Research Center since 1999. We conduct science that
      spans the spectrum from physical readiness to joint medical planning, to wounded
      warrior recovery and behavioral health interventions, all focusing on the health,
      readiness, and well-being of our nation\u2019s military members and their families.
      We conduct research that is operationally relevant and driven by fleet requirements.
      Our core research areas include Operational Readiness and Health, Military Population
      Health, and Operational Infectious Diseases. We are one of eight laboratories
      affiliated with the Naval Medical Research Center in Silver Spring, Maryland,
      within the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Together, we support military
      mission readiness with research and development that delivers high-value, high-impact
      solutions to the health and readiness challenges our military population faces
      on the battlefield, at sea, on foreign shores, and at home. NHRC&#039;s homepage
